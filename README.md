# Homework 3 Flow Visualization with Three.js

For this assignment, we will be working with a computational fluid flow simulation dataset from the San Diego Supercomputing Center. You can learn more about the science behind the simulation here: http://www.uni-kl.de/sciviscontest/

## How to run this code?
1. Clone this repo 
2. Start an http server (with python3): py -m http.server 8950
